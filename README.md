# Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction
The objective of this project is to predict the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - MPG) of various car models based on factors such as the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration. The project aims to identify which features most significantly affect fuel consumption and help improve MPG values in cars.
